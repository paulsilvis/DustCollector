This the fresh start for the DustCollector project.  6 months ago, I started working on this, and now I know enough to actually build it and do a clean job of it.

This vault contains lots of daily notes about what I'm doing when, what decisions I've made and things to do.

The new design doc is completed and located in the 'docs' directory.
