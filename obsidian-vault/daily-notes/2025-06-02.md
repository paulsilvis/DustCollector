- Finished the design doc, had it reviewed and approved by Bob, then checked in. I still need to add things like the requirements.txt, and a list of tools I use like fritzing, diylc, pandocit.sh, and so on.  Might also add a picture of the completed board and the collector itself.  Should probably add a more detailed discussion of the high-level program and the use of asyncio.
- Ordered 4 pcs of a current-sensor board that replaces the one I was trying to build myself -- $20 a pop, but worth eliminating the hassle.
- started a To-Do List [[To-Do List]]
- 
So, what do I WANT to do now?  Not sure.  maybe the dust-level sensor is a good thing to finish off.
