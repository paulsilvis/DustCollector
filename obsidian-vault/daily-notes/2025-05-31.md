Long chat with Bob about setting up a new directory structure and pulling things into it from older stuff as I go about writing a clean design doc, creating a new workflow for building the project and documenting it.

The plan is to use:
	# VSCode for text files (plain text or markdown docs) and code development/debugging.
	# jupyter (in notebooks) for development, experiments and informal testing
	# Obsidian for daily notes and decisions
