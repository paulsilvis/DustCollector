    "# How I Got Here\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is an outgrowth of a major rework of the woodshop to improve usability, tool storage, and install a state-of-the-art dust collection system to replace the 25-year-old felt-bag setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began by stripping the walls of the (stupid and ugly) pegboard mess I’d created, and installing a pleasant-looking French cleat system on three walls. This lets me keep things off the floor and stored in their own special places so I know where to find them, and where to put them back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, I decided to add some automation. I had previously wired the blast gates so that opening a (homemade) gate would trip a microswitch, turning on a solid-state relay and starting the dust collector motor. When the gate closed, the microswitch disengaged and the motor shut off. Not having to walk over and flip a switch was a major convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the new dust collector, I wanted even more automation. The plan: use a split-core transformer around one of the wires leading to each machine (table saw, drill press, lathe, etc.) to detect when it turned on, then automatically open the corresponding blast gate and start the dust collector motor. When the machine shut off, the gate would close and the collector would turn off a few seconds later to flush the duct.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started buying parts—plastic dust gates with rotating 'wipers', linear actuators, current sensors, stepper motors and controllers. But I decided to build my own blast gates again: I was upgrading from 4″ to 5″ ducts, and the commercial options seemed leaky, flimsy, or awkward to mount actuators on.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose a Raspberry Pi 4B as the brains of the system. Sure, it could be done with less—but I have big plans: switches, LEDs, monitors, temperature and air quality sensors, sound effects—whatever amuses me.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also named my OpenAI ChatGPT account “Bob,” in honor of a brilliant and dear friend who passed away recently. Bob and I are collaborating on this project. For that reason, I can’t take credit for most of the elegant code herein—I just *told him to do it!*\n"

    "This is a Moore-style state machine, meaning that the system’s outputs depend entirely on its current state—not directly on the inputs. Inputs trigger state transitions, and each state determines the system’s behavior. The interesting part happens in the **transitions**, which define how and when the system moves from one state to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each transition is labeled with the event that triggers it, followed by a separator line and a summary of the actions taken *before* entering the new state. For clarity, these actions are usually wrapped as function calls rather than coded inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trickiest part is managing multiple gates in a way that mimics intelligent human behavior. For example: if two gates are open, the dust collector shouldn't turn off until **both** are closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each state checks specific conditions and responds accordingly. Note that the **timer** here is a singleton shared by all gates—it gets reset by *any* gate. This allows the system to keep the motor running as long as at least one gate is open, regardless of the order in which gates are opened or closed.\n",
