<h2 id="overview">1. <a name='Overview'></a>Overview</h2>
<p>This project grew out of my original dust collection setup, which I
had hacked with microswitches and a solid-state relay so that when I
opened a blast gate, the dust collector would come on, and when I closed
the gate the dust collector would go off. Since all the relays were
‘or-ed’ together, it would stay on as long as at least one blast gate
was open.</p>
<p>This was easy to do, and reasonably effective. The dust collector
itself, however, was not effective. I had an inexpensive 1.5 HP Delta
machine with heavy felt filter bags. These clogged up quickly with fine
dust from the lathe and heavier dust from the table saw, and when I
measure it I was only getting about 350 CFM.</p>
<p>As the years went on, I developed <em>severe</em> allergy to some
specific types of wood dust. These episodes could last for 3 days of
pure misery. I faced a choice – either give up woodworking altogether or
solve this dust issue.</p>
<p>As I put together a plan for salvaging some parts of the original
collector and upgrading my filtering capacity, I decided that it would
be really <em>cool</em> to do just a bit more automation, and have the
blast gates operate automatically depending on what tools (e.g.,
tablesaw, drillpress) were running.</p>
<p>This would prevent me from being lazy and just using the tablesaw for
a minute or two for a quick cut without walking the 3 steps to the blast
gate. ;-) I did not realize at the time how much saving 3 steps would
cost in both time and money.</p>
<h3 id="essential-goals">1.1. <a name='EssentialGoals'></a>Essential
Goals</h3>
<p>So, the <em>essential</em> goals areh&gt;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open and close appropriate blast gates automatically when any
powered tool is running, and close them when none are running.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor the level of dust in the main collection bin and flash a
visible warning of some kind if it should be emptied soon.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor the amount of fine particulate matter in the air and turn
on a <em>Corsi-Rosenthal</em> air filter that will run until the air has
been ‘clean’ for some time.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the mechanism for opening and closing blast gates is
timely (on the order of 2 seconds or so) and safe from jams (i.e., has
timeouts and limit switches).</p></li>
<li><p>The entire controller must fit inside a wall-mounted enclosure
with a clear door for visibility.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optional-goals">1.2. <a name='OptionalGoals'></a>Optional
Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add displays to show internal states, opening and closing of gates,
collection bin dust level, air pressure in ductwork, etc. Why not –
they’re cheap and they don’t take up a lot of resources</li>
<li>Monitor temperature inside the enclosure and be prepared to shut
down if for some reason things get too hot.</li>
<li>Add lots of digital I/O so I can set up switches for my
grandchildren to push. Some of these may create spooky outer-space
sounds, or activate a voice message or flash some crazy lights. Anything
to amuse them and make them interested in what’s going on here.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-big-picture-physical-system">2.
<a name='TheBigPicture--PhysicalSystem'></a>The Big Picture – Physical
System</h2>
<p>The physical system consists of: - the recycled impeller, housing and
motor from the original dust collection system. - a ‘Dust Deputy’
cyclone to direct most of the heavy debris downwards to … - a collection
bin with a capacity of <tbc> cubit feet - a heavy duty pleated
commercial filter rated MERV 14 that catches particles as small as 1.5
microns, which sits atop… - a removable bucket fastened securely to it
that holds dust released from cleaning the filter by banging on it
<strong>gently</strong> while dousing it with
<strong>low-pressure</strong> compressed air from the outside.</p>
<p>The operation of the impeller motor is controlled by a solid-state
relay whose control input is governed by the DustCollector
controller.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://wynnenv.com/?s=13F230NANO+&amp;post_type=product">canister
filter</a> is from Wynn Environmental, and costs about $230. This
high-efficiency filter traps over 95% of particles sized 3.0-10.0
microns, such as lint, dust, pollen, pet dander, and mold spores, as
well as particles from coughs, sneezes, and smog. Here’s a <a
href="https://www.mechreps.com/PDF/Merv_Rating_Chart.pdf">filter rating
chart</a> to give you more information.</p>
<p>At the botom of the filter a collection bucket is attached with a
“gamma seal” lid – it just twists off.</p>

<p>I settled on a Raspberry Pi 4b for the CPU, with 8GB of ram and a
250G solid state drive. It is programmable in Python, has sufficient
GPIO pins for my needs, support for I2C and very fast serial
communications.</p>
<p>It also has direct support for an HDMI monitor, USB keyboard and
mouse, and sound output. Cool – I can do a lot with that.</p>

<h2 id="key-subsystems">5. <a name='KeySubsystems'></a>Key
Subsystems</h2>
<h3 id="the-motor-subsystem">5.1. <a name='TheMotorSubsystem'></a>The
Motor Subsystem</h3>
<p>There are currently 4 motors planned, one of which is not yet
implemented and is being saved for possible use by the router (mounted
under the table-saw wing) or as an auxiliary port for the small vertical
belt sander..</p>
<p>The main tools are: - the table saw - the lathe - the drill press</p>
<p>Each of these has a 5-inch duct connecting it to the intake of the
dust collector. At some point on the ductwork leading to each tool there
is a blast gate that controls the flow of air into the dust
collector.</p>
<p>Each blast gate has a stepper motor mounted on it to move the gate
opened and closed. Momentary-contact limit micro-switches are mounted at
each end of travel to tell the controller that the blast gate has
reached the desired position. [Note – a timeout will occur if this
hasn’t happened in a reasonable amount of time, and a warning of some
sort will be issued.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PNEQKC0?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_3">stepper
motors</a> are Nema 17 Bipolar, 2A, 59Ncm. These are more than powerful
enough to overcome any friction in the blast-gate slide mechanism.</p>
<h4 id="the-distributor">5.1.1. <a name='TheDistributor'></a>The
Distributor</h4>
<p>The requirement to run the steppers fast enough to satisfy a 2-second
open/close time was difficult to handle with plain old I2C expanders
like the MCP23017 – the bus was just too slow. I opted for creating a
new sub-sub-system called the ‘distributor’ which uses a pair of 8-bit
shift registers and the SPI bus to squirt out enable/step/dir signals to
4 motors quite rapidly. There is a detailed breakdown in the <a
href="#wiring">Wiring</a> section to show how this is mapped to
individual motors.</p>
<h3 id="the-digital-io-subsystem">5.2.
<a name='TheDigitalIOSubsystem'></a>The Digital I/O Subsystem</h3>
<p>The digital I/O is almost entirely managed by a set of PCF8574
I2C-based 8-bit expander boards. 5 of them ganged together gives 40 I/O
bits, which are periodically read into a 40-bit buffer. See the section
on Digital I/O Pin Map for details.</p>
<p>[Yes, this is excessive. I don’t care. I like lots of switches and
buttons.]</p>
<h3 id="the-current-sense-subsystem">5.3.
<a name='TheCurrentSenseSubsystem'></a>The Current Sense Subsystem</h3>
<p>The ‘on’ or ‘off’ state of a given power tool such as the table saw
is determined by detecting the presence or absence of current in a
split-coil transformer wrapped around the ‘hot’ line going to the saw.
This is connected to a custom circuit on the controller that converts
the 0 - 100 mA current into a 0-5V signal to be read by an a/d converter
and converted to a logic value meaning ‘on’ or ‘off’.</p>
<h3 id="the-gate-control-subsystem">5.4.
<a name='TheGateControlSubsystem'></a>The Gate Control Subsystem</h3>
<p>The gate conrol system is responsible for sensing machine state (On
or Off), opening/closing the appropriate blast gate[s] and turning on
(or off) the dust collector impeller motor.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/gate-states.jpg" alt="Gate States" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Gate States</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is currently a provision for a delay before turning off all
tools and turning off the dust collector impeller motor. This is to
allow any remaining dust to be sucked out of the system. It may turn out
that this is unnecessary due to the high velocity of the air in the
ducts (estimated to be over 80 MPH).</p>
<h2 id="the-top-level-software-structure">6.
<a name='TheTopLevelSoftwareStructure'></a>The Top Level Software
Structure</h2>
<p>Although this is not a ‘hard real-time’ problem, there are many
things to keep track of in a timely manner. ‘Bob’<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
suggested using Python’s asyncio package to help with this, and I agree
wholeheartedly. This enables the top-level structure of the program to
be divided cleanly into separate tasks that will not step on each
other.</p>
<h2 id="enclosure">7. <a name='Enclosure'></a>Enclosure</h2>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4M7V61Q?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_5&amp;th=1">enclosure</a>
is an “ABS Electrical Junction Box, Ventilated Design, with Cable
Grommets, IP65 Waterproof Enclosure, Indoor/Outdoor Use with Mounting
Panel.. (Clear Cover, 17.7”x13.7”x7.9”) ” from Amazon.</p>
<p>Connections to the outside world are run via pass-through connectors,
so the entire enclosure can be easily removed from its wall-based
mounting panel for benchwork.</p>
<h2 id="the-monitor-subsystem">8. <a name='TheMonitorSubsystem'></a>The
Monitor Subsystem</h2>
<p>This subsystem is a catch-all for anything I can think of to measure
the system to provide useful information.</p>
<p>Some candidates are: - temperature at various places in the enclosure
(e.g., the Pi computer chip, the motor driver heat-sinks, etc.) -
current draw for 3.3V, 5V and 12V busses. - level of dust in the
collection bin - failure to open or close a blast-gate in time</p>
<p>It is likely that some temperature information may be used to turn on
PC fans to vent the enclosure more thoroughly.</p>
<h2 id="wiring">9. <a name='Wiring'></a>Wiring</h2>
<p>Yes, there are lots of wires here. Many of the cables are custom-made
for these reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Length considerations</li>
<li>Connector type mismatches</li>
<li>Connector pin assignments don’t match.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, some I2C boards have signals in the order [vdd, gnd,
scl, sda], while others switch vdd and ground, and scl and sda. These
cables are labeled and clearly marked as CUSTOM, and usually have a bit
of whiteout to help show what goes to what.</p>
<p>I tried to maintain a consisten color coding scheme for wiring, but
did not succeed completely. In general, however, for power wiring, I
have followed this scheme:</p>
<p>A/C: Neutral – White (referred to as Gnd on the board) Hot – Black
Ground – Green.</p>
<p>D/C: 5V – Orange 3.3V – Black 12V – Red Gnd – White</p>
<p>All Ground connections are tied together on the board.</p>
<p>____Remember – this is not guaranteed! Look at where the wires go to
be sure.____</p>
<h3 id="the-current-sense-circuit">9.1.
<a name='TheCurrentSenseCircuit'></a>The Current Sense Circuit</h3>
<p>This custom circuit board holds 4 identical circuits to convert a
0-100 mA current from a transformer into a small voltage that a
4-channel ADS1115 a/d converter can read.</p>
<p><TBD> Need a circuit diagram here.</p>
<h3 id="the-distributor-1">9.2. <a name='TheDistributor-1'></a>The

<p>This custom circuit board is mounted with the 4 stepper driver
boards. It consists of two 74HC595 8-bit shift registers fed by the fast
SPI interface.</p>
<p><TBD> Need a circuit diagram here.</p>
<p>This is explained in great detail here since it took me a while to
figure it all out and get it straight.</p>
<h5 id="hc595-chaining-and-bit-to-pin-mapping">74HC595 Chaining and
Bit-to-Pin Mapping</h5>
<p>You have chip1 and chip2. As you look at the board, chip1 is on the
left. <strong>Note carefully that the chip on the right (chip2) is
upside down, with pin 1 at the bottom right.</strong>] Here is a
detailed breakdown to show how this is mapped to individual motors.</p>
<p>Each 74HC595 has 8 outputs: Q0–Q7 (pins 15, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). You
are using pins 1-6 (Q1–Q6) on each chip for step/dir/enb. You’re sending
2 bytes over SPI: byte1, byte2.</p>
<h5 id="critical-fact-about-chained-595s">Critical Fact About Chained
595s:</h5>
<p>The first bits shifted out land furthest down the chain. The last
bits shifted out stay closest to the Pi.</p>
<p>Thus: - byte1 → chip2 - byte2 → chip1</p>
<p>Bit-to-Pin Layout (directly from the code)</p>
<pre><code>    Bit  layout  is  based  on  physical  pin  mapping:
    -  High  byte  (bits  15–8)  →  Chip2  (rotated  180°)
    -  Low  byte  (bits  7–0)      →  Chip1  (upright)
    -  Data  sent  MSB  first  (bit  15  down  to  bit  0)



    MOTOR_MAP  =  {
            1:  {&#39;en&#39;:  12, &#39;step&#39;:   13,  &#39;dir&#39;:  14},
            2:  {&#39;en&#39;:  9,  &#39;step&#39;:   10,  &#39;dir&#39;:  11},
            3:  {&#39;en&#39;:  4,  &#39;step&#39;:    5,  &#39;dir&#39;:  6},

    }</code></pre>
<h2 id="in-practical-summary">In Practical Summary:</h2>
<ul>
<li>byte1 → fills chip2 (the far one)</li>
<li>byte2 → fills chip1 (the near one)</li>
<li>Pins 1-6 on each chip will reflect bits 1-6 of each respective
byte.</li>
<li>MSB (bit 7) and LSB (bit 0) could be unused or reserved.</li>
</ul>

<p>When sending: spi.xfer2([byte2, byte1]) # byte2 first for chip1,

<p><strong>Final Word:</strong></p>
<p>Pin 9 (QH*) serial out is ONLY used between chips. After two chips,
if you don’t add more, you can ignore it.</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="the-net-result">The Net Result</h5>
<p>This organization means that it is easy to spot the 3 signals need
for each motor. Take a look at the circuit board and you’ll s “““ee that
E(enable), S(step) and D(dir) are grouped for each motor. Look at the
two shift-register chips. For chip 1 (left) pins 1, 2 and 3 are ESD for
motor 4 (the nearest motor. For chip 2 (right) pins 4, 5 and 6 are ESD
for Motor 1 (the nearest motor). You get the idea. Cool.</p>
<h2 id="power-supplies">10. <a name='PowerSupplies'></a>Power
Supplies</h2>
<p>I decided not to use the Raspberry Pi 4b plug-in power input for
these reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I didn’t know at the beginning how much current I might need</li>
<li>I needed an external 12-volt supply anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both supplies were furnished by Amazon: - [5V supply]
(https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PPPF1R5?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_5&amp;th=1)</p>
<pre><code>      Description:  5V  5A  Power  Supply,25W  Universal  Regulated  Switching  Power  Converter  Adapter  Transformer  for  LED  Strip  Light,Probe  Signal  Lamp,CCTV,  Radio,  Computer  Project  </code></pre>

</ul>
<p>These power supplies are mounted on a separate board that is
detachable from the main mounting board. They are fed from a common A/C
source via GX connectors, and routed into the enclosure with replaceable
fuses in-line.</p>
<h3 id="reboot-shutdown-and-restart">10.1.
<a name='RebootShutdownandRestart'></a>Reboot, Shutdown and Restart</h3>
<p>Both power supplies run through an emergency shutoff switch with a
plastic cover. You probably should not lock the plastic cover – it’s
just there to prevent you from using it as an ordinary shutdown. When
the button is pressed, it shuts off all power to the controller, and
this also cut power to the relay that controls the impeller motor.</p>
<p>The preferred way of shutting down the system is to press the little
button below the emergency shutoff labeled “reboot / shutdown”. If you
press for 1 second or less, it will reboot. If you hold it for more than
2 seconds, it will just shutdown the Raspberry Pi. In
<strong>neither</strong> case will it shut off the power supplies. To
restart the system, push the big red button, then release it by twisting
clockwise.</p>

<p>There are 4 stepper motor DRV8825 driver boards mounted on an acrylic
plate, labeled 1, 2, 3 and 4. In the center of those is a custom-made
circuit board called ‘The Distributor’ which uses the SPI bus to squirt
control bits very rapidly.</p>
<p>The DRV8825 chips are mounted on [Jeanoko DRV8825/A4988 Stable 42

to press the little button below the emergency shutoff labeled “reboot /
shutdown”. If you press for 1 second or less, it will reboot. If you
hold it for more than 2 seconds, it will just shutdown the Raspberry Pi,
In <em>neither</em> case will it shut off the power supplies. To restart
the system, push the big red button, then release it by twisting
clockwise.dt_b_fed_asin_title_1). Each board has a very tiny
potentiometer for adjusting the current limit. You ____must____ adjust
these if you replace them or you run the risk of frying something
important.</p>
<p><strong>Safe VREF Setup Without Motor Connected (Courtesy of
Bob)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
<pre><code>    Prevents  the  chance  of  slamming  full  current  into  the  motor  during  first  power-up.

    Avoids  a  damaged  motor,  a  fried  driver,  or  accidental  runaway  heating.
    </code></pre>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<pre><code>    Install  the  new  DRV8825  board,  BUT  DO  NOT  connect  the  motor  coils  yet.

            Leave  the  motor  wiring  unplugged.

            Only  connect  logic  (VDD,  GND,  STEP,  DIR,  ENABLE)  and  motor  power  (VMOT,  GND).

    Power  up  the  system  (logic  and  VMOT  live).

    Measure  VREF  at  the  trimpot  just  like  before:

            Black  multimeter  probe  to  GND.

            Red  probe  to  the  metal  top  of  the  potentiometer.

    Adjust  VREF  carefully:

            Clockwise  to  increase,  counterclockwise  to  decrease.

            Set  VREF  based  on  the  formula:
            VREF=0.5×Desired  Motor  Current  (A)
            VREF​=0.5×Desired  Motor  Current  (A)

    Confirm  the  VREF  is  in  the  right  ballpark  (e.g.,  0.60V  for  1.2A  motor  current).

    Power  down  the  system.

    Connect  the  motor  coils  properly:

            Double-check  you  know  which  motor  wire  pairs  are  each  coil.

            (If  not  sure,  I  can  give  you  a  10-second  multimeter  method.)

    Power  back  up  and  test  the  motor  gently  (slow  step  pulses  first).</code></pre>
<p>I recommend that you use a very, very tiny phillips screwdriver to do
the adjustment. If you use one that is too large, it will not engage but
will <em>look</em> like its engaged, and nothing will happen (how do I
know this?). The potentiometer is very sensitive, so make tiny
adjustments as you get close.</p>

<p>If you have to replace a power supply, try to get an identical
replacement. Be sure to adjust the voltage output before connecting
it.</p>
